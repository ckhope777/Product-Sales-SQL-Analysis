# Product-Sales-SQL-Analysis
This project uses MySQL to analyze the sales, customer feedback, and operational performance of New-Wheels, a vehicle sales company facing a steady decline in new customers and revenue. The dataset was originally unstructured, dumped as flat files. Using SQL queries, the data was organized and analyzed to extract business insights.
